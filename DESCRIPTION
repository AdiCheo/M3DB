M3DB is the next generation in metagenomic analysis pipelines and datamanagement.

M3DB is written to be extensible and flexible to perform, store, and visualize metagenomic data sets.
At its core it utilizes MeFiT, RDP and STIRRUPS to merges, filter and classify any 16S sequence obtained on next generation sequencing platforms (Illumina/454).
All of this data including the reads themselves are the placed in the data warehouse and compressed.
This data set is then able to be queried, returned to its original form. This reduces the overhead cost of storing this information
and improves performance when quering the data by using mapreduce technologies through Apache Hadoop/Hive.
